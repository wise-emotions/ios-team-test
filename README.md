# Telepass digital iOS Test

Develop an app that shows a Pokémon list with its image and name.
When a user taps on a Pokémon, the app will show a detailed view of Pokémon’s name, images, stats, and category (fire, smoke, etc).

The APIs are available at the [following address](https://pokeapi.co).

## Guidelines

1. Use [Swift 5.5](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-5-released/)
2. Use iOS 11 as Target SDK
3. You can use a few external libraries, and motivate their usage
4. Use the MVVM pattern
5. Use [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), or [SwiftPM](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager), but motivate your choice into the `README.md` file
6. The app’s UI must be dynamic and must support both iPhone and iPad without using XIBs or Storyboards
7. Create a `README.md` file where you describe the project and your choices
8. Put your project on a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
9. Check that your code correctly builds on the latest stable Xcode

## Bonus Tasks

1. Use one external library at most
2. Make the app work seamlessly also offline
3. Write Unit Tests
4. Personalize the project with something that may be useful to this app
